<!--
- Certificates are also known as Maqamat in Spirituality_
- Certificates confer Power_
- |E| represents Money you have_
- The denominator 'T'+1 represents your Age_
- By CERTIFICATE we imply PUBLICLY SHARED Certificate, as Frequency (RHS of the Equation) 
means Communication: the most important thing in War:- particularly since a Singularity 
can easily outmaneuver a Multiplicity if the messages reaches it in time_
- Magnitude means the Constancy or Mark one obtains in attaining the Certificate - it is 
dependent on one's PRACTICE / REPETITION_
- The LHS and RHS of the LOG Equation represent the two Wings of the Eagle: splitting Work between your passion for (study/exhibit of your) Certificates (Maqamat) to a half 
hour AND making Money as fast as possible in the remaining half hour_ 
in  
- The LOG Equation means: Magnitude Of Effort Exerted in The Least Amount Of Time_
